
Before you star printing the motor make sure to have these things at hand.

1. 5mm diameter metal rod.

2. M5 Die ( to thread the rod )

3. 4 x MR95ZZ bearings (they are 9 x 5 x 3 mm) 

4. 4 M3 brass inserts

5. 4 M3 screws

6. 0.5mm copper wire ( make sure to have to have enough wire, at least 20 m, each coil have 20 turns)

When winding the stator you can use 0.5mm wire with 20 turns so you can try to use thinner wire and use more turns for each coil,
of course if you want to experiment. but keep in mind that more turns means less current, and less current means less power.
